                Taxi Rank Web App is a platform designed to manage taxi ranks efficiently.
                Our goal is to streamline the process of managing taxi ranks, including adding new ranks,
                editing existing information, and viewing important details such as destinations and fares.
                With our user-friendly interface and powerful features, we aim to make taxi rank management
                a seamless experience for administrators and users alike.

            Hello, I am Sanele Nkosi, a dedicated professional with a passion for technology and a diverse skill set in software development and IT support. I hold a National Diploma in Software Development, which has equipped me with a solid foundation in programming principles and software engineering practices. Additionally, I have obtained qualifications in IT Technical Support at NQF Level 4, demonstrating my expertise in resolving technical issues and providing effective IT solutions.

My specialization extends to SUSE Enterprise Administration and Advanced Enterprise Administration, where I have acquired comprehensive knowledge and practical experience in managing enterprise-level systems. Moreover, I have furthered my expertise in IT System Support at NQF Level 5, honing my skills in maintaining and optimizing IT infrastructures to ensure seamless operations.

In recognition of the importance of staying updated with industry trends, I have earned certifications from FreeCodeCamp in JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures, as well as Responsive Web Design. These certifications underscore my proficiency in web development and my ability to create efficient and user-friendly web solutions.

Currently, I am gaining valuable hands-on experience as a Systems Engineer Intern at BCX, where I am actively involved in diverse projects and contributing to the enhancement of IT systems and processes. One notable project I have undertaken is the development of a Find Taxi Rank system, which leverages my software development skills to create a user-friendly and efficient solution for locating taxi ranks.

Driven by a passion for innovation and a commitment to excellence, I am eager to continue advancing my career in the field of technology, leveraging my skills and expertise to make meaningful contributions to the organizations I work with.
